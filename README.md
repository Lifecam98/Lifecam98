## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marius, a young man from Tysnes, Norway, an island just south of Bergen. I used to work in the construction industry, more specific as an electrician.
After +-5 years in the industry, I wanted to pursue my dream of working in the IT-industry, specifically in the frontend department.

I find a huge enjoyment creating something special and intriguing that the user have a good experience visiting or using. 
Currently I am studying frontend development at Kodehode/JobLoop, with focus on React and JavaScript.
